		<h1>-Interests-</h1>
		<p>I enjoy watching content creators with creative content, slowly learning music software, and creating videos and graphics for my friends to enjoy.<p/>
		<h1>-Work Statement-</h1>
		<p>I'm aiming to have a career in the multimedia creation field as a designer/editor. Every group i've been a part of whether it be for creative purposes or
		school related, I've learned to have fun with my partners and try to make it an enjoyable and organic experience. Without synergy from others I feel as though
		any type of creative process takes a hit, so it's always been a goal of mine to make the best of any partnered project.</p>
